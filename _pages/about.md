Hi! I'm  Feiyu Jia (贾飞宇), senior undergraduate student from [School of Automation](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). I will pursue a Ph.D. at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) and [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), supervised by [Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/) and [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/). I am now working with [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/) at Shanghai AI Lab. 

My research interest includes Teleoperation, Humanoid robots and Embodied Ai. In my free time, I enjoy traveling and painting. Meanwhile, I am an avid fan of Delta Force: Hawk Ops Partners with Twitch，Valorant.

[HOMIE: Humanoid Loco-Manipulation with Isomorphic Exoskeleton Cockpit](https://roboticsconference.org/program/papers/70/)

Qingwei Ben\*, **Feiyu Jia\***, Jia Zeng, Junting Dong, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang†

[**[Project website]**](https://homietele.github.io/) 
[**[Paper]**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13013)
[**[Code]**](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/OpenHomie/)

HOMIE is a semi-autonomous teleoperation system that combines a reinforcement learning policy for body control mapped to a pedal, an isomorphic exoskeleton arm for arm control, and motion-sensing gloves for hand control, forming a unified cockpit to freely operate humanoids and establish a data flywheel.
